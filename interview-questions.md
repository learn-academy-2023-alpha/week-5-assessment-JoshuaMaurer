2. What is a gem?

Your answer:
A gem in Ruby is a library of code snippets or a program. They are open source and community written. You are able to use install these gems onto your local machine (and later have them as dependencies for for your apps and projects). You are able to use all the functionality of this prewritten code (But you should probably read the documentation so you actually understand how it works and what your doing!) with out having to write it yourself. RubyGems is a package manager for,  your guessed it, Ruby gems! It functions similarly to other package managers such as NPM and Yarn. 

Researched answer:
A Gem in Ruby is prepackaged code that, when installed, gives the user access and the ability to use, the Ruby code and methods that have been prewritten by someone else in the Ruby community. These gems of prewritten code are generally packaged in such a way that they have a specific functionaly and purpose. This includes framesworks that are language specific libraries such as rails. 
These gems are kept, organized and distributed through RubyGems. RubyGems is a package manager just like NPM and Yarn are for Javascriipt and Pip is for python, but it is specific to Ruby. There have currently been over 128 BILLION gems downloaded from the RubyGems.org website.
A Ruby Gem has three main components, the actual code, documentation and a gemspec. The actual ruby code and .rb files are generally kept within the 'lib' directory with the gem. There documentation is generally held within a README file. The gemspec contains other information just as the name and contact info for the author of the gem, version information, and various other information that is pertenant to the gem. Gems can also contain other files such as executables, testing files and others.
Below are two seperate examples. One of a basic file tree of a gem. The other is just a couple of the recognisable gems that we have used in class.
Example:
% tree anturio
anturio/
├── bin/
│   └── anturio
├── lib/
│   └── anturio.rb
├── README
└── anturio.gemspec

Gem examples:
Rspec
Active Record 
Rails
